# Technical Implementation Details

## RAG System Implementation

### Document Processing Pipeline

The RAG system uses a sophisticated document processing pipeline:

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - The system accepts various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and URLs
   - The `process_input()` function in `rag_utils.py` handles different input types
   - For PDF files, PyPDF2 is used to extract text content
   - For DOCX files, the python-docx library extracts text
   - For URLs, WebBaseLoader fetches and processes web content

2. **Text Chunking**:
   - The `CharacterTextSplitter` from LangChain splits documents into manageable chunks
   - Default chunk size is 1000 characters with 100 character overlap for context preservation
   - These parameters are configurable via the UI for optimization

3. **Embedding Generation**:
   - The system uses HuggingFace's sentence transformers for generating embeddings
   - Default model is "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
   - The `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class handles embedding creation

4. **Vector Storage**:
   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides efficient vector storage and retrieval
   - The system creates a vector store from text chunks using the generated embeddings
   - FAISS enables fast similarity search for finding relevant content

### Question Answering Process

When a user asks a question:

1. The question is passed to the `answer_question()` function in `rag_utils.py`
2. The system uses the FAISS vector store to find relevant document chunks
3. These chunks are passed to the LLM (Qwen/QwQ-32B via HuggingFace) as context
4. The LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved context and the question
5. The system returns the answer with associated metadata and source references

## Web Automation System

### Core Components

1. **Browser Management**:
   - The `AdvancedWebScraper` class in `ai_web_automation.py` handles browser initialization
   - Chrome in headless mode is used for web automation
   - Browser configuration includes security settings and performance optimizations

2. **Navigation and Page Loading**:
   - The `navigate_to_url()` method handles URL navigation with error handling
   - Page loading metrics (load time, page size) are captured for analysis
   - A wait mechanism ensures the page is fully loaded before processing

3. **Content Extraction**:
   - BeautifulSoup processes the page HTML for structured content extraction
   - The system extracts text, links, images, and metadata
   - Specialized methods handle structured data like JSON-LD and OpenGraph tags

4. **Site Crawling**:
   - The `crawl_site()` method implements intelligent web crawling
   - Parameters include max pages, domain restrictions, and crawl depth
   - A NetworkX graph tracks site structure during crawling

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Content analysis identifies key topics, entities, and keyword frequencies
   - Link analysis maps site structure and identifies important pages
   - Contact information extraction finds emails, phone numbers, and social links

### Advanced Features

1. **Screenshot Capabilities**:
   - Full-page and element-specific screenshots
   - Image processing for optimization and annotation

2. **Visualization**:
   - Site graph visualization with NetworkX and Matplotlib
   - Content analytics visualization with charts and heatmaps

3. **Data Export**:
   - Structured data export in JSON, CSV, and Excel formats
   - Analysis reports with visualizations and metrics

## Code Assistant Implementation

The code assistant component provides AI-powered code analysis and generation:

1. **API Structure**:
   - FastAPI provides the backend for code assistance functionality
   - A single endpoint (/code-assistant) handles different code-related tasks

2. **Task Types**:
   - Code Analysis: Structure evaluation and best practices assessment
   - Code Generation: Creates code based on descriptions
   - Code Optimization: Improves existing code for performance and readability
   - Bug Finding: Identifies potential issues and suggests fixes

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Uses Groq's llama-3.3-70b-versatile model for code understanding
   - Task-specific prompts guide the LLM for different code operations
   - The system handles various programming languages through language-specific instructions

## Session Management

The session management system handles user state and persistence:

1. **User Sessions**:
   - The `session_manager.py` file implements session handling
   - Sessions track user preferences and interaction history
   - JWT-based authentication for secure session management

2. **State Persistence**:
   - SQLite database stores session information
   - In-memory caching for frequently accessed session data
   - Session recovery mechanisms for handling crashes or disconnections

## Database Architecture

### Schema Design

The system uses SQLite for persistence with the following key tables:

1. **Users Table**:
   - User authentication information
   - Preferences and settings

2. **Sessions Table**:
   - Active user sessions
   - Session metadata and timestamps

3. **Documents Table**:
   - Document metadata
   - Processing status and parameters

4. **QueryHistory Table**:
   - User query history
   - Associated answers and performance metrics

### Database Operations

- `auth_db.py` handles authentication-related database operations
- `check_db.py` provides utilities for database maintenance and verification
- The system uses SQLAlchemy for ORM-based database interactions

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup

The project includes a comprehensive setup script (`setup.py`) that handles:

1. Environment variable configuration
2. Python dependency installation
3. Database initialization
4. System verification

### Running the System

Multiple entry points are available:

- `advanced_rag_app.py`: Standalone Streamlit application for the RAG system
- `code_assistant.py`: FastAPI service for code assistance
- `run_all.py`: Unified entry point that launches all system components

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Batch processing for efficient embedding generation
   - Model selection based on performance/quality trade-offs

2. **Vector Search**:
   - FAISS index optimization for faster similarity search
   - In-memory caching of frequent queries

3. **Web Automation**:
   - Browser resource management for reduced memory usage
   - Parallel processing for multi-page crawling (with rate limiting)

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Context optimization to reduce token usage
   - Result caching for common queries

## Testing Framework

The project includes several test files:

- `test_rag.py`: Tests for the RAG functionality
- `test_web_automation.py`: Tests for web automation features
- `test_ai_web_automation.py`: Tests for advanced web scraping
- `test_code_assistant.py`: Tests for code assistance functionality
- `test_auth.py`: Tests for authentication and session management

These tests ensure system reliability and help prevent regressions during development.
